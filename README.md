# Personal Tech Notes & Cheatsheets

_My external brain for when context switching makes me forget everything_

## What This Is

These are my personal technical notes - the organized chaos of a developer who's tired of googling the same commands for the third time today. Think of it as my documented journey through the ever-shifting landscape of modern development.

> **Core Philosophy**: If I've had to look it up twice, it belongs here.

## How I Organize My Chaos

### My Note-Taking Philosophy

Each section follows my preferred mental model:

- **Quick Commands** - Because muscle memory fails when you need it most
- **Common Patterns** - The solutions I actually use, not textbook examples
- **Personal Gotchas** - Mistakes I've made so you (future me) don't have to
- **Performance Notes** - When things matter and when they don't
- **Context Links** - Breadcrumbs back to deeper understanding

### Content Categories

- **Quick Reference**: For when I know what I want but forgot the syntax
- **Pattern Documentation**: My go-to solutions that actually work in production
- **Learning Notes**: Deeper dives when I needed to really understand something

### Finding Things Later

GitHub search works, but I've learned to be strategic:

- Use specific command terms for copy-paste moments
- Search by problem pattern when debugging
- Look for architecture keywords when designing

## My Knowledge Architecture

### Learning Path Philosophy

Rather than following traditional tech trees, I've found my own progression patterns:

**The Pragmatic Route**: Problem → Solution → Understanding → Documentation

- Start with what breaks or what I need to build
- Find the immediate solution that works
- Circle back to understand the underlying principles
- Document both the solution and the why

**Cross-Technology Insights**

- Backend patterns that translate across languages
- Frontend concepts that survive framework churn
- Infrastructure principles that scale with complexity
- Data patterns that remain relevant despite tooling changes

## Personal Development Philosophy

### Why I Document Everything (Almost)

The uncomfortable truth: I thought I'd remember. I was wrong. Repeatedly.

After the third time explaining the same microservices debugging technique to myself, I realized my brain wasn't a reliable storage system. This repository became my admission that external documentation beats wishful thinking.

### My Content Curation Process

**The Reality Check Filter**: Does this solve actual problems I encounter?

- Not just interesting theoretical concepts
- Solutions that work in messy, real-world scenarios
- Patterns that survive contact with production systems

**The Future-Me Test**: Will this make sense in six months?

- Include enough context to reconstruct my thinking
- Document the alternatives I considered and rejected
- Explain why certain approaches fit specific situations

**The Experience Distillation**: What did I actually learn?

- Beyond just "how to do X"
- Understanding when X is the right choice
- Recognizing when X definitely isn't the answer

### Personal Technology Evolution Patterns

I've noticed my relationship with technologies follows predictable phases:

**Discovery**: "This looks interesting/promising"  
**Honeymoon**: "This solves everything!" (spoiler: it doesn't)  
**Reality Check**: "Okay, this works well for specific problems"  
**Integration**: "This fits into my reliable toolkit"  
**Maintenance**: "I understand its place in the ecosystem"

Understanding this cycle helps me document not just current solutions, but their context and limitations.

## Be Aware: Something Could Be Deprecated

These are my notes and only if I have to revisit I will change it.

### The Documentation Decay Problem

Technical notes have a half-life. Commands change, frameworks evolve, and my own understanding deepens. The challenge isn't just creating documentation—it's maintaining its relevance without becoming a slave to constant updates.

My compromise: Focus on principles and patterns that have staying power, with specific implementation details as examples rather than gospel.
